# Vertigo
=================

A Simple Java Starter kit for **real projects**.

Its main purpose is to publish simple and homogeneous APIs over more complex libraries.

__Vertigo__ is split into different modules, detailed below.

For [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) users, it is advised to use the [KSP Plugin](https://github.com/sebez/vertigo-chroma-kspplugin) to enhance Developer Experience.

## vertigo-core
### Build and configure your own modules 

* __app__ : everything to configure your app
* __component__ : everything about components (fast, simple and lightweight Dependency Injection, simple AOP, proxies)
* __locale__ : manage internationalization of your app (MessageTexts)
* __param__ : a simple way for your business and technical configuration (external and internal)
* __definitions__ : a way to store and access all definitions of your app
* __resource__ : a simple access to resources (builtin : lookup into classpath, webapp, filesystem with relative or absolute path)
* __lang__ : a set of usefull elements such as assertion
 

## vertigo-commons
### A set of common tools 

* __analytics__ : track your process calls, time & errors
* __cache__ : keep your objects in memory to improve performance
* __codec__ : transform an object into another. (built-in codecs : HTML, SHA1, Base64, Compress, Serialize) 
* __daemon__ : manage all your application daemons (registering, stats) 
* __eventbus__ : a simple event bus for handling events in your app  
* __node__ : a simple node management for cluster applications (topology, health, config)
* __config__ : read configs for your application (overridable, externalizable, aggregate multiple configs)
* __peg__ : a simple parser for your [DSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
* __script__ : transform a simple String in an executable script right from your code  (because sometimes you need to merge code and data)
* __transaction__ : simple transaction management 

## vertigo-database
### A simple data access to your databases

* __sql__ : with built-in handlers : Oracle, MSSql, Postgresql, H2, Hibernate

## vertigo-dynamo
### A simple way to define the model for your application and provide useful api over it like storage, search, etc...
  
* __collections__ : collections tools (built-in : fulltext indexation, facetting, filtering)   
* __criteria__ : a unique api to build filters (predicates, sql)
* __domain__ : top-2-bottom POJO to simplify communication between layers from Database to GUI/WS
* __environment__ : initialize your components from different sources (built-in : powerdesigner, DSL, Java annotations)
* __file__ : manage file creation
* __kvstore__ : key/value datastore
* __store__ : simple access to persistence layer  (built-in : route by object type, CRUD operations, NN operations)
* __search__ : simple search api
* __task__ : create and manage various tasks (such as direct queries to databases)


## vertigo-account
### A simple user management system, not only technical.

* __authentication__ : provide a set of connectors to easily manage your end users authentication in your app
* __authorization__ : userSession and security tools to check access to resources (by user roles and/or data properties)   
* __identity__ : a way to store and identify your user accounts


## vertigo-vega
### Share your apps to others.

* __rest__ : Add a REST access layer to your application. Mainly oriented for production-ready Single-Page-Applications. Provides a production-ready security level.


## vertigo-studio
### A set of tools to help you through developpement
* __mda__ : Model Driven Architecture with tools to generate source code (java, sql, js, ts), multilingual properties...
* __reporting__ : a set of tools to build indicators about your app
* __ui__ : more to come

## vertigo-bundle
A bundle of all above modules


## vertigo-parent
just the parent pom
